% The script calculates the error between corner points in the reference
% patch and the corner points of the patch obtained by the registration and
% stores the error, as well as the coordinates in a .csv file


% Script to load SIFTResults.csv in which the transformations returned from
% Fiji after registration using SIFT are stored
Import_SIFTResults;

% Script to load metadata.csv in which the coordinates of the corner points
% of the reference and transformed patches are stored
ImportMetaData;

% Script to load ResultfileTemplate.csv to create a .csv file storing the
% coordinates of the corner points of the patch recovered by registration,
% the details of the modalities registered, as well as the error resulting
% from the registration
